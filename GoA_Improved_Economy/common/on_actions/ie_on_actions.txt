# GoA: Improved Economy - On Actions
# Hooks into game pulses for economic events
#
# NOTE: The 5 MTTH economy events (ie_economy.1 through ie_economy.5)
# use mean_time_to_happen and are evaluated by the engine directly.
# They do NOT need on_actions hooks - the engine handles them.
#
# ie_economy.6 is is_triggered_only (fired by ie_economy.5 chain).
#
# This file provides hooks for future economy features:
#   - Building completion rewards
#   - Trade route disruption events
#   - Yearly economic reports

# Fires for all characters once per year
on_yearly_pulse = {
	events = {
	}
}

# Fires for all characters once every 5 years
on_five_year_pulse = {
	events = {
	}
}

# Fires when a new building is completed
on_building_complete = {
	events = {
	}
}

    "environment": {
      "space": "A colossal stone archway hewn into the face of a weathered cliff, its entrance framed by carved pillars covered in ancient runic script now half-eroded by centuries of wind and rain. The archway is at least twelve metres tall, wide enough for five riders abreast. Beyond the threshold, rough-hewn steps descend steeply into impenetrable darkness. The cliff face extends upward another thirty metres, crowned by gnarled dead trees whose roots claw down the rock like skeletal fingers. Rubble and collapsed masonry litter the ground before the entrance — evidence of old battles or structural decay.",
      "foreground": "Four adventurers stand in a loose formation on the stone-flagged approach, five metres from the entrance. The warrior is front-centre, one gauntleted hand on the hilt of a massive two-handed sword planted point-down in a crack between flagstones. A hooded rogue crouches to the right, daggers drawn, peering into the darkness. A female mage stands to the left, her oak staff crowned with a softly pulsing blue arcane crystal that casts cool light on her features. A plate-armoured healer (paladin) stands behind the group, shield on one arm, the other hand raised with a faint golden holy glow illuminating a prayer. Scattered at their feet: supply packs, coiled rope, a half-unrolled parchment map.",
      "midground": "The entrance archway itself dominates the midground. Its carved pillars depict faded scenes of ancient battles — warriors fighting serpentine creatures, now barely legible under moss and mineral staining. A pair of massive iron braziers flank the entrance, one still burning with dying orange flames that send sparks spiralling upward, the other cold and overturned. Thick cobwebs span the upper corners of the archway. Just inside the threshold, the first three descending stone steps are visible before the darkness swallows everything. A faint greenish bioluminescent glow clings to the wet walls just inside, hinting at what lies below.",
      "background": "Above the cliff face, a turbulent twilight sky in deep indigo and bruised purple, the last ember of sunset visible as a thin amber line on the western horizon. A crescent moon hangs low. The silhouettes of distant mountain peaks frame the scene. A flock of bats streams out from a crack high in the cliff face, spiralling into the darkening sky.",
      "atmosphere": "Threshold tension — the last breath before the plunge. Heroic determination mixed with visceral unease. The warmth of torchlight versus the cold exhalation of subterranean air. A sense of ancient, patient malice waiting below.",
      "weather": "Still evening air with a cold draught flowing outward from the dungeon entrance, visible as wisps of condensation. No rain, but heavy moisture on every stone surface creating subtle reflections.",
      "time_of_day": "Late dusk, approximately 20 minutes after sunset, sky retaining the last purple-amber glow before full darkness"

His two-handed greatsword is planted before him, both hands resting on the cross-guard. A red cloak hangs from his pauldrons, stirred slightly by the dungeon draught. His face is weathered, jaw set, eyes fixed on the darkness ahead. Torchlight catches the scratches and dents in his armour — this is not his first descent. A shield bearing a lion crest is strapped to his back.",

    "environment": {
      "space": "A vast vaulted stone workshop carved into the heart of a mountain, the ceiling lost in smoke and shadow twenty metres above. The room is roughly fifteen metres wide and twenty deep, divided into three distinct working zones: the forge proper on the left with its massive stone hearth and chimney, the enchanting station at centre-rear on a raised stone platform, and the alchemy corner on the right with shelves of glowing potions. The walls are dressed stone — granite blocks fitted without mortar in the dwarven fashion — hung with an arsenal of finished and in-progress weapons, shields, and armour pieces. A central stone-and-iron anvil stands on a raised circular dais, the focal point where all three disciplines converge.",
      "foreground": "The master anvil dominates the foreground — a massive block of dark meteoric iron set on a carved granite pedestal inscribed with dwarven runes that glow faintly orange from internal heat. On its surface, a half-forged longsword blade glows white-orange, fresh from the furnace. Scattered around the anvil's base: heavy tongs, a selection of hammers ranging from delicate jeweller's tools to a massive two-handed sledge, metal filings that glint like gold dust, quenching troughs of dark water with steam wisping upward, and a leather apron draped over a stool.",
      "midground": "Left: the great forge — an enormous stone hearth four metres wide with bellows the size of a horse, operated by chains and gears. The coals within burn white-hot, casting intense orange light. Iron ingots are stacked in neat rows beside it. A weapons rack holds six completed swords, each distinctly different in design. Centre-rear, elevated on a three-step stone platform: an enchanting table of polished dark wood covered in an indigo cloth embroidered with silver constellations. A large open grimoire floats slightly above the table surface, its pages turning slowly by themselves. Purple-violet arcane runes orbit the table in slow concentric circles, casting alien light on the stone walls. Crystal phials of enchanting dust glow in a rack beside it. Right: the alchemy station — floor-to-ceiling wooden shelving crammed with hundreds of glass bottles, flasks, and vials containing liquids in every colour: emerald green, ruby red, sapphire blue, molten gold, midnight black. A copper distillation apparatus with coiled tubes sits on a lower bench, a blue flame beneath a glass retort producing slow bubbling teal liquid. Bundles of dried herbs hang from the ceiling beams.",
      "background": "The rear wall is dominated by a huge stone relief carved in dwarven style — depicting Khaz'goroth the Titan Shaper at his cosmic forge, hammering stars into existence. The carving is partially obscured by the enchanting table's arcane light. High narrow windows cut into the stone wall allow thin shafts of pale daylight to penetrate the smoke, creating visible light beams in the hazy air. Iron chains and pulleys hang from the vaulted ceiling for moving heavy materials.",
      "atmosphere": "Sacred industriousness — the concentrated hush of a master at work. Heat, metal tang, ozone from arcane energy, herbal sharpness from alchemy ingredients. The room hums with latent power. Every surface speaks of centuries of accumulated craft knowledge.",
      "weather": "Interior scene — no weather. The air is hot and thick near the forge, cooler and tinged with ozone near the enchanting table, fragrant and humid near the alchemy station. Smoke and steam layer the upper air.",
      "time_of_day": "Indeterminate — deep interior lit primarily by forge-fire and magical sources. The thin daylight shafts from high windows suggest midday outside."

        "details": "A powerfully built dwarven male, approximately 1.4m tall but immensely broad-shouldered, with arms like tree trunks. His skin is ruddy and weathered, tanned dark by decades of forge heat. A magnificent braided black beard reaches to his waist, the ends capped with small iron rings. He wears a heavy leather apron over a sleeveless chain mail shirt, exposing arms covered in old burn scars and runic tattoos that glow faintly amber. He grips a master smithing hammer in his right hand — a tool of exquisite craftsmanship itself, its head engraved with geometric patterns. His left hand holds the glowing blade on the anvil with long tongs. His expression is one of absolute focused concentration — brow furrowed, eyes narrowed, lips pressed tight. Sweat beads on his forehead, reflecting the forge light. Heavy iron-toed boots, a thick leather belt hung with smaller tools — chisels, files, a measuring caliper.",

Its yellowed pages are covered in dense arcane script that shifts and rearranges itself. The orbiting runes are three-dimensional — geometric shapes of solid purple-violet light rotating in two concentric rings around the table. Small motes of enchanting dust drift upward from open crystal phials like reverse snowfall. The enchanting table itself bears scorch marks and crystalline residue from past enchantments.",

Each contains a distinctly coloured liquid, many glowing with their own internal light. Labels in cramped handwriting are tied to many with string. The distillation apparatus is an intricate assembly of copper coils, glass tubes, and ceramic joints, actively processing — teal liquid dripping slowly into a collection flask. A mortar and pestle sit nearby with crushed iridescent herbs. A small cauldron gently bubbles over a contained blue alchemical flame.",

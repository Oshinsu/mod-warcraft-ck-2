A battered but jubilant raid party stands atop or beside the colossal fallen corpse, weapons raised in victory, illuminated by holy and arcane light breaking through the shattered lair ceiling. This image is shown when the player achieves a Great Success raid outcome. It must convey exhaustion transformed into euphoria, the scale of the achievement, and the earned glory of heroes."

      "space": "A vast dragon's lair — a natural volcanic cavern expanded and reshaped by centuries of the dragon's habitation. The cavern is roughly fifty metres wide and thirty metres tall. The ceiling has been partially shattered by the final battle — a massive jagged hole fifteen metres across lets shafts of golden exterior light pour in from above. The walls are dark volcanic basalt with veins of glowing orange-red magma still visible in cracks. Massive stalactites hang from the intact portions of the ceiling. The floor is uneven, covered in the dragon's hoard: gold coins, gemstones, broken weapons of previous challengers, and scorched bones — now scattered and disrupted by the battle.",
      "foreground": "The dragon's massive head and upper body dominate the foreground, lying on its side in death. The head alone is five metres long — a horned, scaled monstrosity with jaws permanently frozen open in its final roar, revealing rows of sword-length teeth. One enormous amber eye is half-open, dulling as life fades. Dark crimson blood pools beneath the head, mixing with scattered gold coins. Deep wounds are visible — a massive gash across the throat where the killing blow landed, arcane burn marks across the snout, arrows protruding from the neck membrane. One massive clawed forelimb is outstretched toward the viewer, talons still gripping the cracked stone floor. The scales are dark green-black, each the size of a dinner plate, some cracked or missing from combat impacts.",
      "midground": "Standing atop the dragon's shoulder and upper back — seven to eight heroes of the raid party in various postures of victory and exhaustion. The raid leader (a human warrior) stands at the highest point atop the dragon's shoulder blade, greatsword raised overhead in one hand, the other fist clenched skyward, mouth open in a victory cry, silhouetted against the golden light pouring through the ceiling hole. Beside him, a female paladin has driven her banner — a tattered blue-and-gold standard — into the dragon's back, claiming the kill. A mage sits exhausted on the dragon's spine, staff across her knees, head bowed but laughing. An orc shaman kneels, hands pressed to the dragon's scales in a ritual of respect for the fallen foe. Two rogues are already picking through the nearby treasure scatter. A dwarven priest raises a golden holy symbol overhead, golden healing light still radiating from it. Below the dragon, on the cavern floor, more party members are visible — some collapsed from exhaustion, some embracing, some tending to wounded companions.",
      "background": "The shattered ceiling frames a view of a golden sunset sky above the mountain peak — the world outside unchanged and beautiful, contrasting with the underground carnage. Shafts of warm golden light pour through the hole at dramatic angles, illuminating the floating dust and smoke. The far walls of the cavern show more of the dragon's hoard — towering piles of gold, ornate chests, ancient weapons mounted on crude stone racks. The dragon's tail extends into the background darkness, its massive size requiring the entire cavern floor.",
      "atmosphere": "Triumphant exhaustion — the stunned euphoria of survival against impossible odds. The air is thick with smoke, dust, and the metallic tang of dragon blood. Every hero is wounded, torn, bloodied — but alive and victorious. The silence after battle, broken only by victory cries and the crackle of dying fires.",
      "weather": "Interior cavern scene. Post-battle smoke and dust fill the air. Through the shattered ceiling, a clear golden sunset sky is visible. Warm light pours in. Fine debris and ash particles drift in the light shafts.",

Four massive limbs with taloned feet — the right forelimb outstretched, claws gouging furrows in the stone floor. Enormous bat-like wings partially folded, one wing pinned beneath the body, the other draping over a collapsed stalactite. A long sinuous neck ending in a horned head with a crown of six swept-back horns, each one metre long. The killing wound: a massive diagonal gash across the throat, deep enough to expose dark muscle and bone, from which dark crimson blood flows. Dozens of secondary wounds — arrow shafts, arcane scorch marks, axe impacts on scales. The creature is unmistakably dead, but its sheer scale communicates the magnitude of the victory.",
        "scale": "Enormous — the head alone fills the lower-left quarter of the image. The body extends across the full width and into the background. The heroes standing on it appear tiny by comparison, emphasising the achievement."

His plate armour is battered beyond recognition — one pauldron missing entirely, breastplate deeply dented, greaves cracked. But he stands tall, greatsword raised overhead in his right hand, left fist punching the sky, head thrown back in a primal victory roar. His face is bloodied — a gash across his forehead paints half his face red — but his expression is pure wild triumph. His red cloak is reduced to ribbons streaming in the warm updraft from below. He is backlit by the golden sunset light from the ceiling breach, creating a near-silhouette with a divine golden rim-light.",

The banner is torn and burned but still readable — a golden lion rampant on a blue field. It flutters in the updraft. The paladin who planted it stands beside it, one gauntleted hand on the pole, the other resting on her sword pommel. She is a tall human woman in ornate but battle-damaged plate, her own face exhausted but proud. Planting the banner is the symbolic claim of victory.",

On the cavern floor: a dwarven priest raising a golden holy symbol with golden light still emanating, his face split by a gap-toothed grin.

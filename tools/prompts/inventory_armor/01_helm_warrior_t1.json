        "element": "Helm of Might — Tier 1 Warrior great helm",
        "details": "A massive dark iron great helm built for a human or orc warrior of imposing stature. The helm is forged from thick plates of near-black iron with a subtle warm brown patina suggesting volcanic forge origins in the depths of Blackrock Mountain. STRUCTURE: Full bucket-style great helm with a flat crown and angular faceted sides. The visor is open — a wide horizontal eye slit with a thick nasal bar dividing it, flanked by pronounced cheek guards that angle outward slightly. The jawline of the helm is squared and brutal, with three rivets on each side holding the cheek plates to the main shell. HORNS: Two massive bull horns sprout from the temples of the helm, curving outward and then upward in a wide aggressive sweep. The horns are the same dark iron as the helm body but polished smoother, catching more light at their tips and ridged with subtle growth-ring textures along their length. Each horn is approximately one-third the total height of the helm. DETAILS: A reinforced brow ridge runs across the forehead, slightly raised and trimmed with aged bronze. Six dome-headed rivets run along this brow ridge, each with a faint orange-red glow at its base as if still cooling from the forge. The eye slit reveals deep shadow within — absolute darkness suggesting the void behind the visor. The nasal guard is thicker at the base and tapers slightly, with a single shallow groove running its length. Small scratch marks and battle wear are visible across the iron surface — shallow dents, tiny nicks, hairline scratches that catch the light differently from the surrounding metal. The neck guard at the rear flares outward slightly for mobility. MATERIAL QUALITY: The iron has a matte finish with areas of subtle sheen where use has polished it — the brow ridge, the horn bases, the edges of the eye slit. The metal reads as genuinely heavy — thick, substantial, forged not cast.",
        "scale": "The helm fills most of the icon frame — presented at a scale that emphasizes its mass and the width of the horns. It should read clearly even at 64x64 pixel rendering."

      {
        "element": "Rare quality blue glow effect",
        "details": "A soft, diffuse blue glow (#0070dd) emanates from the helm itself, as if the item radiates latent magical energy. The glow is strongest along the edges and silhouette of the helm — particularly the horn tips, the brow ridge, and the lower jaw edge. It bleeds outward approximately 5-8% of the frame into the dark background, creating a subtle halo. The glow is not uniform — it pulses slightly brighter at the horn tips and the rivets, suggesting enchantment focal points. This is the signature rare-quality item glow from World of Warcraft, immediately readable to any WoW player as a blue-quality item.",
        "scale": "The glow extends just beyond the helm's silhouette, creating a thin luminous border effect"

      "fill_light": "Subtle cool blue-grey ambient fill from the lower-right, approximately 20% intensity of the key light, preventing the right side from falling into total blackness while maintaining dramatic contrast. This fill picks up the edges of the right horn and right cheek guard.",

The shadow side of the helm maintains just enough detail to read the form.",

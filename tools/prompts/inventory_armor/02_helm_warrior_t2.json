        "element": "Helm of Wrath — Tier 2 Warrior great helm",
        "details": "A breathtaking full-face great helm forged from polished blue steel, the pinnacle of warrior armor craftsmanship. STRUCTURE: The helm has a rounded dome crown with a prominent central ridge running from the forehead to the nape, rising into a tall golden crest. The face is protected by a full plate construction with a narrow T-shaped visor slit — a horizontal eye slit intersected by a vertical nasal bar, both edged in gold. The cheek guards are broad and sweep downward to protect the jaw, each with an embossed golden dragon scale motif. The entire helm surface is polished blue steel — a distinctive cold blue-tinted metal with an almost mirror-like sheen in the highlights that fades to deep navy in the shadows. DRAGON WING ORNAMENTS: The defining feature — two magnificent golden dragon wings rise from the temples of the helm, one on each side. Each wing is an ornamental plate shaped like a stylized dragon wing with three to four elongated pointed pinions sweeping backward and upward. The wings are burnished gold with engraved feather-scale texturing, each pinion edged with a slightly brighter gold. The wing bases connect to the helm at ornate golden rosette mounts. These wings add dramatic width to the helm's silhouette, extending outward and upward impressively. GOLDEN CREST: A tall golden crest rises from the central ridge of the helm — a tapered blade-like fin of gold that curves slightly backward. The crest is engraved with a dragon motif in relief — a sinuous dragon body winding upward. The crest catches light brilliantly, serving as the topmost point of the helm. TRIM AND DETAILS: All edges of the blue steel plates are bordered with fine gold trim — the eye slit, the jawline, the crown ridge, the neck flare. Three small gold studs run along each cheek guard. The steel surface shows not battle damage but master polish — subtle reflective variations that read as carefully maintained ceremonial armor. The inside of the visor slit reveals controlled darkness — deep shadow but not the absolute void of the T1 helm, suggesting the refined interior padding of a lordly helm.",
        "scale": "The helm fills the icon frame generously — the wing tips extend to near the frame edges, establishing a wide majestic silhouette"

        "element": "Epic quality purple glow effect",
        "details": "A rich, regal purple glow (#a335ee) emanates from the helm, stronger and more saturated than a rare blue glow. The aura is most intense along the golden elements — the wing tips, the crest peak, and the gold trim lines — as if the enchantment lives within the gold itself. The purple glow extends approximately 8-10% of the frame into the dark background, creating a prominent luminous halo. The glow has a subtle warm quality within the purple spectrum, leaning slightly toward magenta at the brightest points near the gold. This is the signature epic-quality item glow from World of Warcraft, immediately communicating to any player that this is a coveted epic drop.",

        "details": "An exquisite open circlet designed for a mage of the highest arcane order, blending precious metalwork with enchanted cloth and a centerpiece gemstone. STRUCTURE: The circlet is a curved band of burnished gold that wraps around the head in a gentle arc — not a full enclosed helm but an open crown. The band is approximately two fingers wide, with a slight upward peak at the center front where the gem is mounted. The band tapers gently toward the sides where it would connect behind the head (the rear is not visible in this presentation angle). CENTRAL GEMSTONE: The crown's focal point is a large oval-cut arcane gemstone mounted in an elaborate gold setting at the forehead center. The gem is a deep violet-purple with an internal glow — light seems to come from within the stone, creating a luminous depth effect. The gem's facets catch light in pale lavender-white sparkles across its surface, while the core radiates a soft purple luminescence. The setting around the gem features four gold prongs and an ornate gold bezel with tiny engraved arcane rune marks. Above the gem, the gold band rises into a small pointed peak or finial. FILIGREE: The gold band is decorated with intricate filigree work — scrolling vine-like patterns of thin gold wire soldered onto the band surface, with tiny gold bead accents at the scroll terminals. The filigree has a slightly three-dimensional raised quality, catching light differently from the smooth band beneath. CLOTH DRAPES: From each side of the circlet, hanging from small gold rings at the temple positions, are cloth side drapes made of rich royal purple silk. These drapes are approximately the same length as the circlet's height, hanging down in gentle folds. The cloth is luxurious — smooth with subtle sheen, the folds creating light and dark purple gradations. The bottom edges of the drapes are trimmed with a thin gold thread border and terminate in tiny gold tassel points. The cloth suggests this is a scholar's crown, not a warrior's helm — elegant, refined, deliberately unwieldy in combat.",
        "scale": "The circlet fills the frame width generously with the cloth drapes adding vertical extent — overall a wide, low-profile silhouette distinct from the tall warrior helms"

The glow outlines the gold metalwork edges and the tips of the cloth drapes. The interaction between the blue item-quality glow and the purple arcane energy of the crown itself creates a layered luminous effect — blue on the outer edge, transitioning to purple closer to the item.",

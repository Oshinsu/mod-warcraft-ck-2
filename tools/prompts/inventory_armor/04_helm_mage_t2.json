        "element": "Netherwind Crown — Tier 2 Mage headpiece",
        "details": "A breathtaking arcane crown that transcends mere jewelry into the realm of magical apparatus — a device for channeling and focusing nether energies. STRUCTURE: The base is a slender silver circlet band, more refined and thinner than the T1 crown, with a slightly raised center front mounting platform. The silver is polished to a mirror finish with subtle cool blue undertones. The band features etched geometric patterns — concentric arcs, arcane circles, and precise line work that suggests magical circuitry rather than decorative filigree. SWEEPING WING ORNAMENTS: Rising from the temples of the circlet, two magnificent sweeping wings made of thin silver metalwork extend upward and backward. Unlike the warrior's solid gold dragon wings, these are skeletal and elegant — thin silver framework forming wing-bone structures with translucent purple crystalline membrane panels between the silver ribs. Each wing has four primary vanes that sweep upward in a graceful arc, the tips slightly curved and razor-sharp. The silver framework of the wings is etched with the same arcane circuit patterns as the band. The translucent purple membranes between the wing ribs glow with faint internal light, appearing almost like stained glass. PURPLE CRYSTAL CENTERPIECE: A large pointed amethyst-like crystal is mounted at the forehead, projecting slightly forward and upward. The crystal is a deep saturated purple with extraordinary internal luminosity — it appears to contain a swirling vortex of nether energy within, light spiraling inside the faceted form. The crystal is hexagonal in cross-section, tapering to a sharp point at the top. It sits in a precision-cut silver mounting cradle with six articulated prongs. The crystal's glow illuminates the surrounding silver metalwork with a wash of purple light. At the crystal's base, tiny tendrils of purple energy appear to arc between the prongs, as if the mounting is actively containing the crystal's power. DETAILS: Small secondary crystals — three on each side — are mounted along the circlet band between the forehead crystal and the wing bases. These are smaller pointed purple crystals, each glowing faintly in resonance with the central stone. The entire piece has an engineered precision that suggests archmage artificery rather than traditional jewelry-making.",
        "scale": "The wings extend the silhouette dramatically beyond the circlet band width, creating a tall and wide crown profile that dominates the icon frame"

        "element": "Epic quality purple glow effect",
        "details": "An intense purple glow (#a335ee) radiates from the crown, particularly from the central crystal and the wing membrane panels. The glow is rich and saturated, creating a prominent halo around the entire piece. The crystal serves as the primary glow source, with nether-purple light radiating outward in all directions. The wing membranes glow as secondary sources. The effect creates a layered luminous aura — bright magenta-purple nearest the crystal, fading to softer lavender-purple at the edges of the halo. Faint arcs of purple energy occasionally bridge between the crystal and the wing tips.",

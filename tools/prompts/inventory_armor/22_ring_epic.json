A powerful magical ring made of intertwined gold and mithril silver bands. A large brilliant-cut deep purple amethyst gemstone set in an ornate raised bezel, emitting visible arcane light rays and small floating magical particles. Ancient microscopic runes engraved inside the band, barely visible. The gem seems to contain a swirling miniature galaxy within. Ancient, powerful, mysterious artifact. Purple epic quality (#a335ee) arcane aura radiating from the gem. Centered composition at slight angle to show the band's roundness. No fingers, single item, dark background.",

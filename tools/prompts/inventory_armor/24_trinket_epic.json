A mysterious ancient trinket \u2014 a palm-sized golden mechanical device that combines gnomish clockwork precision with raw arcane crystal power. Tiny visible rune-etched brass gears mesh perfectly around a central pulsing arcane crystal core that glows violet-blue. The device seems to be perpetually in motion, gears turning, crystal humming. Gnomish engineering meets high arcane magic. Enigmatic, complex, powerful. Purple epic quality (#a335ee) glow pulsing from the crystal core. Centered composition.

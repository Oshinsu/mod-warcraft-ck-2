The metal is dark grey iron — not polished steel — with visible hammer marks from rough forging, minor surface pitting, and a few nicks along the cutting edges from prior use. No engravings, no runes, no magical effects whatsoever. The crossguard is a simple straight bar of the same dark iron, slightly wider than the blade, with squared-off ends — purely functional, zero ornamentation. The grip is wrapped in cracked, worn brown leather with visible stitching coming undone at one end, revealing the wooden core beneath. The pommel is a plain disc of iron, slightly dented, serving only as a counterweight. There is a faint patina of age on all metal surfaces. The blade has no sheen beyond a single dull specular highlight along the edge where a whetstone was last applied — suggesting the weapon is maintained but unexceptional.",

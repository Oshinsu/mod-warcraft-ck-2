The green gem in the pommel and faint emerald glow signal 'uncommon' immediately. The steel is polished, the craftsmanship deliberate. Still grounded and believable, but clearly superior to common iron."

        "details": "A well-crafted steel longsword approximately 95cm in total length, visibly superior to common ironwork. The blade is straight, double-edged, made of polished steel with a mirror-like sheen along its fuller and visible grain pattern in the metal suggesting careful folding during forging. The blade edge is keen and unblemished — no nicks, no pitting — with a bright specular line running its full length. A single shallow decorative groove parallels the fuller on each flat of the blade. The crossguard is slightly upcurved at the tips, forged from the same quality steel but with brass wire inlay in a simple knotwork pattern along its length — a mark of a smith who takes pride in work. The grip is wrapped in dark oiled leather, tightly and evenly wound with brass wire cross-wrapping at quarter intervals for improved purchase. The pommel is a faceted steel octagon housing a single oval-cut green gemstone (emerald or peridot) approximately 12mm across, set in a brass bezel. The gem emits a faint, steady green luminescence (#1eff00) — not magical fireworks, but a subtle inner glow suggesting the stone holds a minor enchantment. This glow is the primary visual indicator of uncommon quality.",

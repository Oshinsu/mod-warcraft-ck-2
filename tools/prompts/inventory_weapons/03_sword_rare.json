        "details": "A menacing curved sword approximately 100cm in total length, forged from dark blued steel that appears almost black. The blade has a pronounced curve reminiscent of a bastardized scimitar or tachi, single-edged with a wickedly sharp convex cutting edge and a reinforced spine. The steel itself has a dark blue-black patina with subtle swirling patterns in the metal — suggesting it was quenched in something other than water. Carved into both flats of the blade are runic inscriptions — seven distinct runes on each side, each approximately 15mm tall, cut deep into the steel and filled with a self-luminous blue magical energy (#0070dd). The runes pulse with a slow, steady rhythm like a heartbeat, casting shifting blue light onto the blade surface and creating small caustic light patterns. Faint wisps of blue energy (#4a9eff) trail upward from the topmost runes like cold flame. The crossguard is fashioned from dark iron wrought into the shape of two stylized bat wings or demonic pinions, sweeping forward and downward with sharp pointed tips. The grip is wrapped in black leather over what appears to be a bone core — the texture suggests dried sinew binding rather than conventional stitching. The pommel is a finely detailed human skull carved from aged ivory or bone, approximately 30mm across. The skull's eye sockets are hollow but emit a faint blue luminescence matching the blade runes, suggesting the enchantment permeates the entire weapon. The jaw is clenched, the expression frozen in a silent scream. Small cracks web across the skull surface, dark with age.",

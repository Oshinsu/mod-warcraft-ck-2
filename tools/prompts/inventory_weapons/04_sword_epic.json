        "details": "An enormous two-handed greatsword approximately 160cm in total length — a weapon clearly designed for a warrior of superhuman strength. The blade is wide (12-15cm across at the base), double-edged, tapering to a reinforced clipped point. The steel is dark grey-blue with a polished but ominous sheen, and the blade surface bears the subtle grain of dragonscale-patterned Damascus folding — as if the metal itself was forged using dragon scales as a flux. Running down the blade center, occupying the space where a traditional fuller would be, is a channel of carved purple runic script — twelve ancient draconic runes that glow with a deep, throbbing purple energy (#a335ee). The glow pulses slowly, like the heartbeat of a sleeping dragon, and tendrils of purple magical mist curl from the rune channel. The crossguard is the weapon's most dramatic feature: two sweeping dragon wings forged from antique gold-plated steel, each wing spanning outward approximately 20cm from the blade. The wings are anatomically detailed with individual membrane sections, bone-like structural veins, and sharp pointed tips at each wing apex. The wings sweep forward and upward protectively. At the center of the crossguard where the wings meet the blade, a carved dragon head faces outward — mouth open, tiny amethyst eyes glowing purple. The grip is long enough for two hands (35cm), wrapped in black dragonskin leather with gold wire cross-binding in a scale pattern. The pommel is a large faceted amethyst crystal, roughly cut, set in a gold dragon-claw mounting — four golden talons grip the purple gem, which glows with internal magical light matching the blade runes.",

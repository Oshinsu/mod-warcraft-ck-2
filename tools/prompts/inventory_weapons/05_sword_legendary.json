        "details": "A breathtaking elemental sword approximately 110cm in total length, its form existing at the boundary between physical weapon and living storm. The blade is an elongated, slightly curved single-edged form with a dramatic forked tip that splits into two prongs like a lightning bolt frozen in metal. The lower two-thirds of the blade is forged from dark teal-blue storm-metal — an alloy that seems to contain swirling cloud patterns within its surface, as if a thunderhead was compressed into steel. The metal has a wet, electrically charged sheen. The upper third of the blade transitions from solid metal into crackling, arcing electrical energy — the steel appears to dissolve into pure lightning, with jagged bolts of cyan-blue electricity (#00ccff) leaping between the two forked blade tips and arcing outward into the surrounding air. The transition zone where metal becomes energy is the most visually intense area: white-hot (#ffffff) at the conversion points, surrounded by branching electrical fractals. Small chain-lightning arcs continuously jump from the blade to the crossguard, from the blade tip into empty air, and between the forked prongs. The crossguard is a sweeping angular form of the same storm-metal, shaped like swept-back wind or stylized lightning bolts, with its tips crackling with small electrical discharges. The grip is wrapped in a material that appears to be woven from metallic storm-grey threads, and it vibrates with visible electrical energy running through it — tiny arcs of lightning visible crawling along its surface. The pommel is an orb of contained ball lightning — a sphere of roiling blue-white electrical energy held in place by a cage of storm-metal wire, constantly flickering and pulsing, the most intense small light source on the weapon.",

Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros \u2014 a colossal flaming warhammer of mythic power. The hammer head is forged from living magma and dark iron, its surface a churning mix of solidified black volcanic rock cracking open to reveal blindingly bright molten orange-yellow magma beneath. Eternal flames wreath the striking surface, with concentric rings of fire energy orbiting the head. The haft is dark iron wrapped in fiery chains that glow red-hot. Lava drips and ember particles trail from the weapon. Intense orange legendary quality (#ff8000) fire glow radiating massively. Diagonal orientation. The weapon of a Fire God. No hands, single item, dark background, readable at 80x80.",
